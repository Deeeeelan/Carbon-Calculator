            What are carbon emissions?
        </button> 
        <div id="carbonEmissions" class="info"> <!--Uses the same id used when the function is called-->
            Carbon emissions are the release of compounds containing carbon into the atmosphere created by industrial processes, which include burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity and power vehicles.

        <!--Harm of carbon compounds-->
        <button class="dropdown" onclick="displayInfo('harmful')"> <!--unique id for each button-->
            Why are carbon compounds harmful?
        </button> 
        <div id="harmful" class="info">
            These compounds trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change as Earth's temperatures increase. This leads to shrinking ice caps, rising ocean levels, warmer temperatures, and air pollution, all of which harms the environment.

        <!--Why this matters-->
        <button class="dropdown" onclick="displayInfo('issue')">
            Why should we care?
        </button> 
        <div id="issue" class="info">
            As high-income countries grow, their carbon footprint grows along with it, increasing the amount of carbon emissions emitted per person. According to the World Bank, the average person in the United States, emits <b>13.83 tons</b> of carbon per year, almost <b>3 times</b> the global average. Large amounts of carbon emissions leads to global warming, destroying habitats and animals.

        <!--Methods to reduce carbon emissions-->
        <button class="dropdown" onclick="displayInfo('method')">
            How can we reduce our carbon emissions?
        </button> 
        <div id="method" class="info">
            Transportation methods account for <b>15%</b> of the world's carbon emissions. By reducing our reliance on motorized vehicles, we can reduce our consumption of fossil fuels and our carbon footprint. Instead of driving to the nearby park, you can help the planet by walking or biking instead. Using electric vehicles or renewable energy sources, such as solar power, can also help reduce carbon emissions.
        </div>

        <!--What about electric cars?-->
        <button class="dropdown" onclick="displayInfo('ev')">
            What about electric vehicles?
        </button> 
        <div id="ev" class="info">
            Electric cars are an alternative to using gas cars, as they are environmentally friendly and do not release carbon emissions. However, that also depends on where and how the electricity is sourced.
