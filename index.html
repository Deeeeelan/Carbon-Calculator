            Carbon emissions are the release of compounds containing carbon into the atmosphere. 
        </div>

        <h4>Why are they harmful?</h4> These compounds trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.
        

        <h5>What is the purpose of the calculator?</h5>This carbon emission calculator tells you how many carbon emissions you release using either a car, plane,, or train based on how many miles you traveled. It helps you become more aware of your impact on the environment, and changes you can make to decrease your carbon footprint.
