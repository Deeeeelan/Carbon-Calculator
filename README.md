# Carbon Calculator
Created for the OCSEFHacks 2025 Hackathon
## Inspiration
We were inspired by all of our collective appreciation for nature and want to make a change. We decided to create this application to make a small impact of our own and have something to build off from for the future. 
## What it does
The Carbon Calculator takes an input of the user's distance travelled in miles and what mode of transport they used, calculating the approximate amount of carbon dioxide emissions contributed by the user as well as fun facts, extra information, and recommendations.
## How we built it
We used VSCode HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python when building our application. We also used Live Share to easily collaborate together and use all of our individual skills to create a viable program.
## Challenges we ran into
For all of us, this was the first time we have ever used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to integrate user input with the website. This made it hard to build our application, and there was a lot of on the spot learning.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that even though this was our first time using most of the langauges we were working with, we perseveared and were able to learn on the spot to create an application that is viable enough to compete with. 
## What we learned
We learned the basics of using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as how to create a user input-oriented application. We learned to take input, calculate it and display the final result on the page. To add, we even achieved a higher goal of creating an interactive map using a Google Maps API.
## What's next for Carbon Calculator 
We plan on adding more facts, suggesting alternatives to reduce carbon emissions based on the map, and adding more modes of transport when inputing data about the distance directly on the map to help users make an even more precise calculation of how many carbon emissions they are releasing on trips.
